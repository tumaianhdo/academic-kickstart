Tu Mai Anh Do is a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California, and a Graduate Research Assistant in the Science Automation Technologies group at the USC Information Sciences Institute. His research covers several areas in Data Analytics and High Performance Computing. He received his B.E. in Computer Engineering from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam National University.

His research topic mainly focuses on in situ data management of scientific workflows on heterogeneous memory systems. In particular, his work is more concerned about data coordination perspective to execute efficiently in situ analysis that co-locates with large-scale simulation across deep memory hierarchies in leadership-class computing platforms.
